description: My very first blog ever.
---
I have been thinking for quite some time now about what my very first blog is going to be.

I had a few silly ideas as to how I would wanna do it. The first one was to do it on a Friday night after I've just gone out with friends, maybe had a few drinks (by a few I mean a lot) and then wrote down whatever came to mind. As you can see this idea never came to life because I couldn't even keep my eyes open after I came back that night. Or else, my first blog is gonna be like azxcjnkfgndlgnf;ldf... ðŸ¥´

My second idea was to do it on the weekend where I thought I'd have more time to plan what I was going to write properly. Well, this didn't happen either because I had other plans during the day and that made me P R O C R A S T I N A T E.

Anyways, I'm writing this blog now in the middle of a Thursday night as I grew sick and tired of waiting and planning for the right moment with the perfect content. What I've always realised in a situation like this is that once my brain kicks into full-gear, I just tend to overthink and procrastinate even more.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I still don't know what the theme of my blog is going to be. I did think of narrowing it down to my interests, or profession but at the same time, I just want to have the freedom to steer away from those things every once in a while and write some silly stuff that pops in my head on a day-to-day basis.

Maybe the theme of my blog is to have **no theme**, to step into the unknown, to read the unexpected, and to laugh at the little things you never thought about, and maybe learn a thing or two about how our mind works.
